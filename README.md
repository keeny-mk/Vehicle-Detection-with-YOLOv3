# Vehicle-Detection-with-YOLOv3
 Detecting and counting vehicles in the scene, including Cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc. The object type will be recorded to give a general idea of traffic flow and congestion. We aim to have a mAP score of over 60 and for the software to be able to detect said objects on 30 fps video at least.  
 - A custom dataset is downloaded using OIDv4 Toolkit.  
 - Using the darknet framework we trained a YOLOv3 model on our dataset and acquired the resulting weights to build our application
